# The app for the tipsy time traveler in all of us:

This is an application that was created during my time at Code Chrysalis where we are given a single day to build a working MVP.

The purpose of this app is to provide a way to track not only the amount of drinks during a session, but also to track the actual drink, how it was, and with simple geo-tagging, where it (and you) were. All the info gathered in a session is presented in an easy to view dashboard with a visual representation as well as a log of your previous session. Learn your limits, track your consumption, and never again forget where you found your new favorite drink!
